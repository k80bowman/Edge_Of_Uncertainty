          Really, all the books here stood out to me as books I'd love to read. Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's memoir sounds fascinating. I still have my copy of her book <i>The Harmless People</i> which I read in a previous life as an anthropology student. <i>The Boiling River</i>, <i>Wild By Nature</i>, and <i>Walking the Nile</i> sound like true, old school, amazing adventures. And the fiction, one for older audiences and one for younger, look like the kind of stories that sweep you in, hold on tight, and possibly break your heart.<a href="/2016/03/14/Feb_Books.html"> . . .</a>

          Ever since I had to read Christa Wolf's <i>Cassandra</i> in college, I've been fascinated with the Trojan War and Homer's <i>Iliad</i>. I've read all sorts of books that have to do with the Trojan War, from the <i>Iliad</i> itself to Margaret George's <i>Helen of Troy</i> to Madeline Miller's <i>The Song of Achilles</i>. And there are many more that I still want to read. But, despite all of that, I have never felt the same level of fascination for Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>.<a href="/2016/02/20/Odyssey.html"> . . .</a>

          I have completely neglected this blog for the last few months. But now I'm back and I have a list of great adventure books that have come out over the last few months. <p>There are a few biographies and books for younger readers on this list. A couple of them concerned forced adventures, journeys endured rather than enjoyed. This is an important aspect of adventure writing that often gets overlooked. Not all adventures are positive. <i>The Lightless Sky</i> is about a boy who is a refugee from Afghanistan and his escape from that country and the danger that faced him there.</p> <p>There are also several books for younger readers. I'm particularly interested in <i>The Fox and the Star</i> and <i>Anna and the Swallow Man</i>.</p><a href="/2016/02/06/Nov-Dec-Jan_Books.html"> . . .</a>

          Unless you pay close attention to either women's history or the history of computers, you've probably never heard of Lady Ada Lovelace. And I can almost guarantee you've never heard of Charles Babbage. And yet their ideas are what made the world the live in today—a world in which we carry small computers in our pockets—possible.<a href="/2015/12/02/Lovelace_and_Babbage.html"> . . .</a>

          This month I have some fiction! Well, three fiction books out of eight. But one of them is Volume Two of <i>Lumberjanes</i> (I reviewed Volume 1 in September) and that ought to count for something. More than something. I've already read it. It's amazing. You should pick it up. <p>Of the other books that came out in October, I think I'm most excited about <i>The Best American Travel Writing 2015</i> and <i>Radiance</i>. <i>The Best American Travel Writing 2015</i> has essays from some amazing writers I've read before (Paul Theroux, Maud Newton, Gary Schteyngart) and some that I'm sure are equally amazing, but that I just haven't come across yet. <i>Radiance</i> just looks incredible. It's described as "a decopunk pulp SF alt-history space opera mystery" and I don't even know what that means, but I want to find out.</p><a href="/2015/11/11/October_Books.html"> . . .</a>
