          I have completely neglected this blog for the last few months. But now I'm back and I have a list of great adventure books that have come out over the last few months. <p>There are a few biographies and books for younger readers on this list. A couple of them concerned forced adventures, journeys endured rather than enjoyed. This is an important aspect of adventure writing that often gets overlooked. Not all adventures are positive. <i>The Lightless Sky</i> is about a boy who is a refugee from Afghanistan and his escape from that country and the danger that faced him there.</p> <p>There are also several books for younger readers. I'm particularly interested in <i>The Fox and the Star</i> and <i>Anna and the Swallow Man</i>.</p><a href="/2016/02/06/Nov-Dec-Jan_Books.html"> . . .</a>

          Unless you pay close attention to either women's history or the history of computers, you've probably never heard of Lady Ada Lovelace. And I can almost guarantee you've never heard of Charles Babbage. And yet their ideas are what made the world the live in today—a world in which we carry small computers in our pockets—possible.<a href="/2015/12/02/Lovelace_and_Babbage.html"> . . .</a>

          This month I have some fiction! Well, three fiction books out of eight. But one of them is Volume Two of <i>Lumberjanes</i> (I reviewed Volume 1 in September) and that ought to count for something. More than something. I've already read it. It's amazing. You should pick it up. <p>Of the other books that came out in October, I think I'm most excited about <i>The Best American Travel Writing 2015</i> and <i>Radiance</i>. <i>The Best American Travel Writing 2015</i> has essays from some amazing writers I've read before (Paul Theroux, Maud Newton, Gary Schteyngart) and some that I'm sure are equally amazing, but that I just haven't come across yet. <i>Radiance</i> just looks incredible. It's described as "a decopunk pulp SF alt-history space opera mystery" and I don't even know what that means, but I want to find out.</p><a href="/2015/11/11/October_Books.html"> . . .</a>

          Every month tons of new adventure books are published. And every month I realize that I will never be able to actually read them all. But I wanted to provide a list of a few adventure books that were published last month that are definitely going on my to-be-read list.
<p>September's list, for some reason, is all non-fiction. That's odd for me. Most of the books are also nature books, highlighting a facet of the natural world. One that I am especially excited about is the illustrated edition of Darwin's <i>The Voyage of the Beagle</i>. Well, that and Ferlinghetti's <i>Writing Across the Landscape</i>. I would expect to see at least one of those two reviewed here in the near future.</p><a href="/2015/10/07/September_Books.html"> . . .</a>

          I wish that there was actually a place called Miss Quinzella Thiskwin Penniquiqul Thistle Crumpet's Camp for Hardcore Lady-Types. I really do. I would drop everything and go there right now to spend the rest of my days earning Lumberjane badges and having adventures with the best friends that I would surely meet there.<a href="/2015/09/08/Lumberjanes.html"> . . .</a>
