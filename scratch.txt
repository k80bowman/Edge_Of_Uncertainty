excerpt: "This month I have some fiction! Well, three fiction books out of eight. But one of them is Volume Two of <i>Lumberjanes</i> (I reviewed Volume 1 in September) and that ought to count for something. More than something. I've already read it. It's amazing. You should pick it up.

<p>Of the other books that came out in October, I think I'm most excited about *The Best American Travel Writing 2015* and <i>Radiance</i>. <i>The Best American Travel Writing 2015</i> has essays from some amazing writers I've read before (Paul Theroux, Maud Newton, Gary Schteyngart) and some that I'm sure are equally amazing, but that I just haven't come across yet. <i>Radiance</i> just looks incredible. It's described as "a decopunk pulp SF alt-history space opera mystery" and I don't even know what that means, but I want to find out.</p>"
