I still have my copy of her book <i>The Harmless People</i> which I read in a previous life as an anthropology student. <i>The Boiling River</i>, <i>Wild By Nature</i>, and <i>Walking the Nile</i> sound like true, old school, amazing adventures. And the fiction, one for older audiences and one for younger, look like the kind of stories that sweep you in, hold on tight, and possibly break your heart."

Really, all the books here stood out to me as books I'd love to read. Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's memoir sounds fascinating. I still have my copy of her book *The Harmless People* which I read in a previous life as an anthropology student. *The Boiling River*, *Wild By Nature*, and *Walking the Nile* sound like true, old school, amazing adventures. And the fiction, one for older audiences and one for younger, look like the kind of stories that sweep you in, hold on tight, and possibly break your heart.

**Dreaming of Lions: My Life in the Wild Places**

*Elizabeth Marshall Thomas*

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781603586399">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dreaming-Lions-Life-Wild-Places/dp/1603586393">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/919859486">Library</a> | <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26715483-dreaming-of-lions">Goodreads</a></p>

>Dreaming of Lions traces Thomas’s life from her earliest days, including when, as a young woman in the 1950s, she and her family packed up and left for the Kalahari Desert to study the Ju/Wa Bushmen. The world’s understanding of African tribal cultures has never been the same since. Nor has Thomas, as the experience taught her not only how to observe, but also how to navigate in male-dominated fields like anthropology and animal science and do what she cared about most: spending time with animals and people in wild places, and relishing the people and animals around her at home.
><br/>
><br/>
>Readers join Thomas as she returns to Africa, after college and marriage, with her two young children, ending up in the turmoil leading to Idi Amin’s bloody coup. She invites us into her family life, her writing, and her fascination with animals―from elephants in Namibia, to dogs in her kitchen, or cougars outside her New England farmhouse. She also recounts her personal struggles, writing about her own life with the same kind of fierce honesty that she applies to the world around her, and delivering a memoir that not only shares tremendous insights, but also provides tremendous inspiration.

**The Boiling River: Adventure and Discover in the Amazon**

*by Andrés Ruzo*

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501119477">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boiling-River-Adventure-Discovery-Amazon/dp/1501119478">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/905685900">Library</a> | <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25205390-the-boiling-river">Goodreads</a></p>

>When Andrés Ruzo was just a small boy in Peru, his grandfather told him the story of a mysterious legend: There is a river, deep in the Amazon, which boils as if a fire burns below it. Twelve years later, Ruzo—now a geoscientist—hears his aunt mention that she herself had visited this strange river.
><br/>
><br/>
>Determined to discover if the boiling river is real, Ruzo sets out on a journey deep into the Amazon. What he finds astounds him: In this long, wide, and winding river, the waters run so hot that locals brew tea in them; small animals that fall in are instantly cooked. As he studies the river, Ruzo faces challenges more complex than he had ever imaged.

**Wild by Nature: From Siberia to Australia, Three Years Alone in the Wilderness on Foot**

*by Sarah Marquis*

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250081971">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Nature-Siberia-Australia-Wilderness/dp/1250081971">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/929155308">Library</a> | <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663856-wild-by-nature">Goodreads</a></p>

>In Wild by Nature, National Geographic Explorer Sarah Marquis takes you on the trail of her ten-thousand-mile solo hike across the remote Gobi desert from Siberia to Thailand, at which point she was transported by boat to complete the hike at her favorite tree in Australia.
><br/>
><br/>
>Against nearly insurmountable odds and relying on hunting and her own wits, Sarah Marquis survived the Mafia, drug dealers, thieves on horseback who harassed her tent every night for weeks, temperatures from subzero to scorching, life-threatening wildlife, a dengue fever delirium in the Laos jungle, tropic ringworm in northern Thailand, dehydration, and a life-threatening abscess.
><br/>
><br/>
>This is an incredible story of adventure, human ingenuity, persistence, and resilience that shows firsthand what it is to adventure as a woman in the most dangerous of circumstance, what it is to be truly alone in the wild, and why someone would challenge themselves with an expedition others would call crazy. For Marquis, her story is about freedom, being alive and wild by nature.

><br/>
><br/>
>Thirty-five years later, a Portuguese pathologist devoted to the murder mysteries of Agatha Christie finds himself at the center of a mystery of his own and drawn into the consequences of Tomás’s quest.
><br/>
><br/>
>Fifty years on, a Canadian senator takes refuge in his ancestral village in northern Portugal, grieving the loss of his beloved wife. But he arrives with an unusual companion: a chimpanzee. And there the century-old quest will come to an unexpected conclusion.
><br/>
><br/>
>The High Mountains of Portugal—part quest, part ghost story, part contemporary fable—offers a haunting exploration of great love and great loss. Filled with tenderness, humor, and endless surprise, it takes the reader on a road trip through Portugal in the last century—and through the human soul.
