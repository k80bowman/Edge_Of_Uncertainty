Every month tons of new adventure books are published. And every month I realize that I will never be able to actually read them all. But I wanted to provide a list of a few adventure books that were published last month that look interesting.

This month I have some fiction! Well, three fiction books out of eight. But one of them is Volume Two of *Lumberjanes* (I reviewed [Volume 1](http://edgeofuncertainty.com/2015/09/08/Lumberjanes.html) in September) and that ought to count for something. More than something. I've already read it. It's amazing. You should pick it up.

Of the other books that came out in October, I think I'm most excited about *The Best American Travel Writing 2015* and *Radiance*. *The Best American Travel Writing 2015* has essays from some amazing writers I've read before (Paul Theroux, Maud Newton, Gary Schteyngart) and some that I'm sure are equally amazing, but that I just haven't come across yet. *Radiance* just looks incredible. It's described as "a decopunk pulp SF alt-history space opera mystery" and I don't even know what that means, but I want to find out.

**The Best American Travel Writing 2015**

*edited by Andrew McCarthy and Jason Wilson*

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780544569645">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Travel-Writing-2015/dp/0544569644">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922687833">Library</a> | <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23719269-the-best-american-travel-writing-2015">Goodreads</a></p>

>In his introduction, guest editor Andrew McCarthy says that the best travel writing is “the anonymous and solitary traveler capturing a moment in time and place, giving meaning to his or her travels.” The stories in The Best American Travel Writing 2015 demonstrate just that spirit, whether it is the story of a marine returning to Iraq a decade after his deployment, a writer retracing the footsteps of humanity as it spread from Africa throughout the world, or looking for love on a physics-themed cruise down the Rhone River. No matter what the subject, the writers featured in this volume boldly call out, “Yes, this matters. Follow me!”

**Almost Anywhere: Road Trip Ruminations on Love, Nature, National Parks, and Nonsense**

*by Krista Schlyer*

>At twenty-eight years old, Krista Schlyer sold almost everything she owned and packed the rest of it in a station wagon bound for the American wild. Her two best friends joined her—one a grumpy, grieving introvert, the other a feisty dog—and together they sought out every national park, historic site, forest, and wilderness they could get to before their money ran out or their minds gave in.

**Boundless: Tracing Land and Dream in a New Northwest Passage**

*by Kathleen Winter*

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781619025677">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boundless-Tracing-Dream-Northwest-Passage/dp/1619025671">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/903424563">Library</a> | <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20662570-boundless">Goodreads</a></p>

>In 2010, bestselling author Kathleen Winter (Annabel) embarked on a journey across the storied Northwest Passage, among marine scientists, historians, archaeologists, anthropologists, and curious passengers. From Greenland to Baffin Island and all along the passage, Winter bears witness to the new math of the North—where polar bears mates with grizzlies, creating a new hybrid species; where the earth is on the cusp of yielding so much buried treasure that five nations stand poised to claim sovereignty of the land; and where the local Inuit population struggles to navigate the tension between taking part in the new global economy and defending their traditional way of life.

**Radiance**

*by Catherynne M. Valente*

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780765335296">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Radiance-Novel-Catherynne-M-Valente/dp/0765335298">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908146174">Library</a> | <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490533-radiance">Goodreads</a></p>

>Severin Unck's father is a famous director of Gothic romances in an alternate 1986 in which talking movies are still a daring innovation due to the patent-hoarding Edison family. Rebelling against her father's films of passion, intrigue, and spirits from beyond, Severin starts making documentaries, traveling through space and investigating the levitator cults of Neptune and the lawless saloons of Mars. For this is not our solar system, but one drawn from classic science fiction in which all the planets are inhabited and we travel through space on beautiful rockets. Severin is a realist in a fantastic universe.
>But her latest film, which investigates the disappearance of a diving colony on a watery Venus populated by island-sized alien creatures, will be her last. Though her crew limps home to earth and her story is preserved by the colony's last survivor, Severin will never return.
>Told using techniques from reality TV, classic film, gossip magazines, and meta-fictional narrative, Radiance is a solar system-spanning story of love, exploration, family, loss, quantum physics, and silent film.

>What does it take to move forty dogs, three sleds, twenty tons of food and gear, and six men from all over the world across nearly four thousand of the coldest miles on earth? Cathy de Moll, the executive director of the 1990 International Trans-Antarctica Expedition, introduces the wild cast of characters who made it happen, on the ice and off: leaders Will Steger and Jean-Louis Etienne, who first met accidentally, on the way to the North Pole; Valery Skatchkov, the Soviet bureaucrat who supplied a "hot" Russian airplane; Yasue Okimoto, who couldn't bear to leave headquarters in Minnesota while her boyfriend was on the ice; Qin Dahe, the Chinese member of the team, who didn't know how to ski; the millions of children who followed the expedition in schools around the world, learning about the fragility and ferocity of the seventh continent; and many others.
