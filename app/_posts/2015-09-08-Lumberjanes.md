I wish that there was actually a place called Miss Quinzella Thiskwin Penniquiqul Thistle Crumpet's Camp for Hardcore Lady-Types. I really do. I would drop everything and go there right now to spend the rest of my days earning Lumberjane badges and having adventures with the best friends that I would surely meet there.

*Lumberjanes Vol. 1, Beware the Kitten Holy*, collects the first four issues of the Lumberjanes comic, written by Noelle Stevenson and Grace Ellis, created by Shannon Watters, Grace Ellis, and Noelle Stevenson, and illustrated by Brooke Allen. The story follows five friends—Mal, Molly, Jo, Ripley, and April—as they battle three-eyed foxes, explore a mysterious cave, and deal with yetis, all while staying true to the Lumberjane motto: "Friendship to the Max!"

This is the kind of book that I wish there were more of. Because I want to read them and, mostly, because I want to give them to my daughter to read. She's six and I would love for her to have more books that show girls having fun adventures and kicking butt and being smart. I want her to have more books about girls in which being a girl isn't the defining factor.

And that, for me, is one of the wonderful things about this book. Yes, the characters are all girls. Yes, they are at a camp for "hardcore lady-types." But foremost, and above all that, they are people. The fact that they are female people doesn't define what they think they can or cannot do. Each character has her own style and interests and each character is loved and valued for who she is as an individual. I really, really want more books, especially books for kids, that do this. And not just for girls. For everyone.

The most wonderful thing about this book, however, is that it is just plain fun to read. It's listed for fifth grade and up, but I loved it every bit as much as my six-year-old. The illustrations are fantastic, the stories are fun, and the characters leaped right off the page and into my heart.

[Volume two](http://www.amazon.com/Lumberjanes-Vol-2-Noelle-Stevenson/dp/1608867374) is due out in October and I can't wait.
