> Knowledge is an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty.
>
>-- <cite>Jacob Bronowski</cite>

I found that quote when looking for a title for this blog and, even though it's not what Bronowski meant, I fell in love with the idea of adventure being beyond the edge of uncertainty, beyond the edge between what is familiar and what is unknown, pushing past the comfortable and mundane. That's what adventure is all about, right? Moving into a space--be it physical, mental, or theoretical--where everything is uncertain and unknown?

I do love a good adventure. I also happen to love a good book. And so adventure books hit kind of a sweet spot with me. Plus, they're a great way to get in a little adventure when travel is not on the immediate horizon.

I'm looking forward to sharing some great books with you here. If you have any thoughts on things I've written, recommendations, questions, etcetera, please contact me.

Here's to moving beyond the edge of uncertainty!
