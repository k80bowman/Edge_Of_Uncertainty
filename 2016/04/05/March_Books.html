    <p>March was a little light, as far as adventure books, go. Really light, in fact. I only have two. But they both look excellent. <em>The Gutsy Girl</em> by Caroline Paul is a book I wish I’d had as a young soon-to-be adventurer. As for <em>Delilah Dirk and the King’s Shilling</em>, I ran out and bought that one the day it came out. I’m a huge fan of the first book in Tony Cliff’s series, I’m excited to read the second.</p>

<strong>The Gutsy Girl: Escapades for your Life of Epic Adventure</strong></p>

<p><em>Caroline Paul, illustrated by Wendy MacNaughton</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781632861238">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Gutsy-Girl-Escapades-Adventure/dp/1632861232">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907966106">Library</a> | <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663599-the-gutsy-girl">Goodreads</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>n The Gutsy Girl, author Caroline Paul emboldens girls to seek out a life of exhilaration. Once a young scaredy-cat herself, Caroline decided that fear got in the way of the life she wanted–of excitement, confidence, self-reliance, friendship, and fun. She has since flown planes, rafted big rivers, climbed tall mountains, and fought fires as one of the first female firefighters in San Francisco. In The Gutsy Girl, she shares her greatest escapades as well as those of other girls and women from throughout history, and offers engaging activities such as confidence-building stances, creating a compass, positive self-talk, and using crickets to estimate outside temperatures. Each section includes a place for girls to “journal” their adventures, thus encouraging a new generation to develop a zest for challenges and a healthy relationship to risk. The Gutsy Girl is Lean In for young girls, a book about the glorious things that happen when you unshackle from fear and open up to exhilaration. Fully illustrated and enlivened throughout by bestselling illustrator Wendy MacNaughton’s whimsical pen-and-ink drawings.</p>

<strong>Delilah Dirk and the King’s Shilling</strong></p>

<p><em>by Tony Cliff</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Globetrotting troublemaker Delilah Dirk and her loyal friend Selim are just minding their own business, peacefully raiding castles and and traipsing across enemy lines, when they attract the unwanted attention of the English Army. Before they know it, Delilah and Selim have gotten themselves accused of espionage against the British crown!
<br />
<br />
Delilah will do whatever it takes to clear her good name, be it sneaking, skirmishing, or even sword fighting… But can she bring herself to wear a pretty dress and have a nice cup of tea with her mother? Delilah Dirk may be defeated at last. By tulle.</p>
