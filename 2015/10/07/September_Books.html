    <p>Every month tons of new adventure books are published. And every month I realize that I will never be able to actually read them all. But I wanted to provide a list of a few adventure books that were published last month that are definitely going on my to-be-read list.</p>

<p>September’s list, for some reason, is all non-fiction. That’s odd for me. Most of the books are also nature books, highlighting a facet of the natural world. One that I am especially excited about is the illustrated edition of Darwin’s <em>The Voyage of the Beagle</em>. Well, that and Ferlinghetti’s <em>Writing Across the Landscape</em>. I would expect to see at least one of those two reviewed here in the near future.</p>

<strong>Writing Across the Landscape: Travel Journals 1960-2013</strong></p>

<p><em>by Lawrence Ferlinghetti</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781631490019">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Across-Landscape-Journals-1960-2013/dp/163149001X">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902661510">Library</a> | <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25622234-writing-across-the-landscape">Goodreads</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the course of an adventured-filled life, now in its tenth decade, Lawrence Ferlinghetti has been many things: a poet, painter, pacifist, publisher, courageous defender of free speech, and owner of San Francisco’s legendary City Lights bookstore. Now the man whose A Coney Island of the Mind became a generational classic reveals yet another facet of his manifold talents, presenting here his travel journals, spanning over sixty years. Selected from a vast trove of mostly unpublished, handwritten notebooks, and edited by Giada Diano and Matthew Gleeson, Writing Across the Landscape becomes a transformative work of social, cultural, and literary history.</p>

<strong>Ocean Country: One Woman’s Voyage from Peril to Hope in her Quest To Save the Seas</strong></p>

<p><em>by Liz Cunningham</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781583949603">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ocean-Country-Womans-Voyage-Peril/dp/1583949607">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898228420">Library</a> | <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25852915-ocean-country">Goodreads</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Ocean Country</em> is an adventure story, a call to action, and a poetic meditation on the state of the seas. But most importantly it is the story of finding true hope in the midst of one of the greatest crises to face humankind, the rapidly degrading state of our environment. After a near-drowning accident in which she was temporarily paralyzed, Liz Cunningham crisscrosses the globe in an effort to understand the threats to our dazzling but endangered oceans. This intimate account charts her thrilling journey through unexpected encounters with conservationists, fishermen, sea nomads, and scientists in the Mediterranean, Sulawesi, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Papua, New Guinea.</p>

<strong>The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt’s New World</strong></p>

<p><em>by Andrea Wulf</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385350662">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Invention-Nature-Alexander-Humboldts/dp/038535066X">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/911240481">Library</a> | <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995249-the-invention-of-nature">Goodreads</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) was an intrepid explorer and the most famous scientist of his age. In North America, his name still graces four counties, thirteen towns, a river, parks, bays, lakes, and mountains. His restless life was packed with adventure and discovery, whether he was climbing the highest volcanoes in the world or racing through anthrax-infected Siberia or translating his research into bestselling publications that changed science and thinking. Among Humboldt’s most revolutionary ideas was a radical vision of nature, that it is a complex and interconnected global force that does not exist for the use of humankind alone.</p>

<strong>Of Bonobos and Men: A Journey to the Heart of the Congo</strong></p>

<p><em>by Deni Béchard</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781571313454">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Men-Journey-Heart-Congo/dp/1571313451">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/921935166">Library</a> | <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25074323-of-bonobos-and-men">Goodreads</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bonobos have captured the public imagination in recent years, due not least to their famously active sex lives. Less well known is the fact that these great apes don’t kill their own kind, and that they share nearly 99% of our DNA. Their approach to building peaceful coalitions and sharing resources has much to teach us, particularly at a time when our violent ways have pushed them to the brink of extinction. Animated by a desire to understand bonobos and learn how to save them, acclaimed author Deni Ellis Béchard traveled into the Congo.</p>

<strong>Deep South: Four Seasons on Back Roads</strong></p>

<p><em>by Paul Theroux</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780544323520">Indiebound</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Deep-South-Four-Seasons-Roads/dp/0544323521">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904755965">Library</a> | <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23719344-deep-south">Goodreads</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paul Theroux has spent fifty years crossing the globe, adventuring in the exotic, seeking the rich history and folklore of the far away. Now, for the first time, in his tenth travel book, Theroux explores a piece of America theDeep South. He finds there a paradoxical place, full of incomparable music, unparalleled cuisine, and yet also some of the nation’s worst schools, housing, and unemployment rates. It’s these parts of the South, so often ignored, that have caught Theroux’s keen traveler’s eye.On road trips spanning four seasons, wending along rural highways, Theroux visits gun shows and small-town churches, laborers in Arkansas, and parts of Mississippi where they still call the farm up the road the plantation. He talks to mayors and social workers, writers and reverends, the working poor and farming families the unsung heroes of the south, the people who, despite it all, never left, and also those who returned home to rebuild a place they could never live without. From the writer whose great mission has always been to transport us beyond that reading chair, to challenge himself and thus, to challenge us (“Boston Globe”), “Deep South “is an ode toa region, vivid and haunting, full of life and loss alike.</p>
